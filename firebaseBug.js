The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is missing required fields, such as the apiKey or databaseURL.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes, especially if error handling isn't implemented correctly.

Example of an incomplete configuration:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  projectId: "my-project-id"
};
```
This is missing the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, `storageBucket`, etc.
